# Thermostat
This browser based application is based on the functions of a standard Thermostat. The core functionality has
been created using pure Javascript and is fully tested using Jasmine.
                            
An external API from Open Weather Map has been integrated to display the current weather dependant on the users location.
                           
The front end is basic CSS combined with jQuery, most notably the background changing colour once low, medium or high
usage has been reached. An additional temperate range can be reached depending on whether the power saving mode is switched on or off
